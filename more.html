      A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a
      person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions
      caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn
      around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet,
      including metal bands, leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. A
      pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached
      to a chain. Watches appeared in the 16th century. During most of its
      history, the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered
      by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance
      wheel. These are called mechanical watches.[1][2] In the 1960s the
      electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and
      kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz watch
      had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch. Historically,
      this is called the quartz revolution (also known as the quartz crisis in
      Switzerland).[3][4] Developments in the 2010s include smart watches, which
      are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a
      wrist. They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are
      only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities. In general, modern
      watches often display the day, date, month, and year. For mechanical
      watches, various extra features called "complications", such as moon-phase
      displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included.
      Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related
      features such as timers, chronographs, and alarm functions. Furthermore,
      some modern watches (like smart watches) even incorporate calculators,
      GPS[5] and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring
      capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly
      correct the time. Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have
      quartz movements. However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for
      their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than
      for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements,
      despite being less accurate and more expensive than their electronic
      counterparts.[3][4][6] As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at
      auction was the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world's
      most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching US$24 million (CHF
      23,237,000) in Geneva on 11 November 2014.[7][8][9][10][11] As of December
      2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction (and wristwatch) was
      the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010, fetching US$31.19
      million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019.[12]
